# CPP Modules

## Module 00
Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams,
initialization lists, static, const

* ex00 > **Megaphone** - *standard output*
* ex01 > **My Awesome PhoneBook** - *classes, member functions, stdio streams*
* ex02 > **The Job Of Your Dreams** - *initialization lists, static, const*

## Module 01
Memory allocation, pointers to members,
references, switch statement

* ex00 > **BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ** - *object allocations and pointers*
* ex01 > **Moar brainz!** - *allocation of an array of objects, corresponding free*
* ex02 > **HI THIS BRAIN** - *pointer vs reference*
* ex03 > **Unnecessary violence** - *difference between a pointer and a reference (ref can be assigned only to a defined element with a defined address)*
* ex04 > **Sed is for losers** - *filestream i/o, string manipulation (emulates sed replacing one word with another)*
* ex05 > **Harl 2.0** - *pointers to member functions (creating an array of pointers to function)*
* ex06 > **Harl filter** - *switch statement*

## Module 02
Ad-hoc polymorphism *(function overloading)*, operator overloading
and Orthodox Canonical class form *(default methods, see ex00)*, fixed-point numbers

* ex00 > **My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form** - *Fixed-point numbers (representation of real numbers in computing that have a fixed number of digits for the fractional part)*
* ex01 > **Towards a more useful fixed-point number class** - *function overload, operator overload, conversion functions*
* ex02 > **Now we’re talking** - *several types of operator overload*
* ex03 > **BSP** - *use of the class created before for a pratctical application (calculating if a point is inside a triangle)*

## Module 03
Inheritance

* ex00 > **Aaaaand... OPEN! (ClapTrap)** - 
*implementing a class (ClapTrap) with variables and member functions*
* ex01 > **Serena, my love! (ScavTrap)** - *inheritance (creation of a subclass), member functions overload*
* ex02 > **Repetitive work (FragTrap)** - *same as the previous exercise, just different values*
* ex03 > **Now it’s weird! (DiamondTrap)** - *diamond inheritance: inheritance from classes that have a common base class*

## Module 04
Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

* ex00 > **Polymorphism** - *Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism, the choice
of which overloaded function to choose im made at run time depending from the object calling it and not at compile time depending on the input parameters). Declaring 
a function virtual and implementing its polymorphism in the subclasses*
* ex01 > **I don’t want to set the world on fire** - *memory leaks, allocation and free*
* ex02 > **Abstract class** - *same as ex01, but the base class is abstract (one function is set = 0). Abstrac means objects of the base class can't be instantiated*
* ex03 > **Interface & recap** - *general recap with different classes, subclasses and interfaces*
