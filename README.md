# CPP Modules

## Module 00
Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams,
initialization lists, static, const

* ex00 > **Megaphone** - *standard output*
* ex01 > **My Awesome PhoneBook** - *classes, member functions, stdio streams*
* ex02 > **The Job Of Your Dreams** - *initialization lists, static, const*

## Module 01
Memory allocation, pointers to members,
references, switch statement

* ex00 > **BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ** - *object allocations and pointers*
* ex01 > **Moar brainz!** - *allocation of an array of objects, corresponding free*
* ex02 > **HI THIS BRAIN** - *pointer vs reference*
* ex03 > **Unnecessary violence** - *difference between a pointer and a reference (ref can be assigned only to a defined element with a defined address)*
* ex04 > **Sed is for losers** - *filestream i/o, string manipulation (emulates sed replacing one word with another)*
* ex05 > **Harl 2.0** - *pointers to member functions (creating an array of pointers to function)*
* ex06 > **Harl filter** - *switch statement*

## Module 02
Ad-hoc polymorphism *(function overloading)*, operator overloading
and Orthodox Canonical class form *(default methods, see ex00), fixed-point numbers*

* ex00 > **My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form** - *Fixed-point numbers (representation of real numbers in computing that have a fixed number of digits for the fractional part)*
* ex01 > **Towards a more useful fixed-point number class** - *function overload, operator overload, conversion functions*
* ex02 > **Now weâ€™re talking** - *several types of operator overload*
* ex03 > **BSP** - *use of the class created before for a pratctical application (calculating if a point is inside a triangle)*
