/* ABSTRACT:
	Recap with classes, abstract classes, inheritance, allocation
	and interfaces (see down)

	run make verbose to have a message from the used functions
 */

/* STRUCTURE:

	(ICharacter) Character--> 
				(IMateriaSource) MateriaSource--> 
							(Amateria) --> (Cure, Ice)

	Let's crack down all this classes of this a bit complex exercise:
	-- Amateria: abstract class to implement the Materia classes Ice and Cure
		No memory allocation for this three classes, just the .clone() function returns
		a pointer to a dinamically allocated object (which is though stored and consequentially 
		freed in the MateriaSource class.
		functions: use() to display what the materia does
	-- (IMateriaSource) is just the interface of MateriaSource:
		learnMateria(): learns some AMaterias and stores them in an array of 4 elements.
		createMateria(): clones the required element reading from its own library.
	-- (ICharacter) is just the interface of Character
 */

/* INTEERFACES:
	In object-oriented programming (OOP), an interface is a programming construct 
	that defines a contract or a set of methods that a class must implement.
	In c++ there are no Interfaces but you can achieve a similar result with abstract
	classes (you declare the functions = 0 and so the subclasses will have to implement them)
